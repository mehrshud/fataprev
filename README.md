# Professional Preview Portfolio (Redesigned)

A polished, mobile-first portfolio page with live GitHub signals, refined cards, Quick View modals, and thoughtful motion design. Built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a small amount of vanilla JS‚Äîno build step required.

> This redesign was created after reviewing the existing single-file page and retaining the strongest ideas (dynamic GitHub hydration, reveal-on-scroll) while improving structure, accessibility, and aesthetics.
